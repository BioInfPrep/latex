abstract = {We report first non-covalent and exclusively extracellular inhibitors of 14-3-3 protein-protein interactions identified by virtual screening. Optimization by crystal structure analysis and in vitro binding assays yielded compounds capable of disrupting the interaction of 14-3-3$\sigma$ with aminopeptidase N in a cellular assay.},

abstract = {Small-molecule stabilization of protein-protein interactions is an emerging field in chemical biology. We show how fusicoccanes, originally identified as fungal toxins acting on plants, promote the interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with the human potassium channel TASK-3 and present a semisynthetic fusicoccane derivative (FC-THF) that targets the 14-3-3 recognition motif (mode 3) in TASK-3. In the presence of FC-THF, the binding of 14-3-3 proteins to TASK-3 was increased 19-fold and protein crystallography provided the atomic details of the effects of FC-THF on this interaction. We also tested the functional effects of FC-THF on TASK channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Incubation with 10 $\mu$M FC-THF was found to promote the transport of TASK channels to the cell membrane, leading to a significantly higher density of channels at the surface membrane and increased potassium current.},
